Here are the most common ways to say \\\"hi\\\" in Portuguese, with explanations for when to use them.\\n\\n### The Short & Simple Answer\\n\\nThe most common and informal way to say hi is:\\n\\n**Oi!** (Pronounced: *oy*)\\n\\nThis is like saying \\\"Hey!\\\" and is used constantly in Brazil.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### More Options (Formal & Informal)\\n\\nHere’s a more complete guide, from casual to more formal:\\n\\n| Greeting | Pronunciation | Formality | When to Use |\\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\\n| **Oi!** | *oy* | Informal | With friends, family, and in casual situations. Very common in Brazil. |\\n| **Olá!** | *oh-LAH* | Standard | A safe and friendly \\\"Hello!\\\" that works in any situation. It's more common than \\\"Oi\\\" in Portugal. |\\n| **Bom dia** | *bong DEE-ah* | Standard | \\\"Good morning.\\\" Used until around noon. |\\n| **Boa tarde** | *boh-ah TAR-djee* | Standard | \\\"Good afternoon.\\\" Used from noon until sunset. |\\n| **Boa noite** | *boh-ah NOY-tchee* | Standard | \\\"Good evening\\\" or \\\"Good night.\\\" Used from sunset onwards. Also used to say goodbye at night. |\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Very Informal & Slang (Mostly in Brazil)\\n\\nThese are like \\\"What's up?\\\" and are used with close friends.\\n\\n*   **E aí?** (eh ah-EE?) - Literally \\\"And there?\\\" but means \\\"What's up?\\\"\\n*   **Tudo bem?** (TOO-doo beng?) - Literally \\\"Everything well?\\\" but often used as a greeting, just like \\\"How's it going?\\\"\\n*   **Beleza?** (beh-LEH-zah?) - Literally \\\"Beauty?\\\" but means \\\"All good?\\\"\\n\\n### Putting It Together in a Conversation\\n\\n**Casual:**\\n> **Person 1:** Oi, E aí? Tudo bem?\\n> (*Hey, what's up? All good?*)\\n>\\n> **Person 2:** E aí! Tudo bem, e você?\\n> (*Hey! All good, and you?*)\\n\\n**Standard/Polite:**\\n> **Person 1:** Olá, bom dia.\\n> (*Hello, good morning.*)\\n>\\n> **Person 2:** Bom dia! Tudo bem?\\n> (*Good morning! How are you?*)\\n\\nSo, for a simple \\\"hi,\\\" you can confidently use **Oi!** (especially in Brazil) or **Olá!** (anywhere).\",\"refusal\":null,\"reasoning\":\"1.  **Deconstruct the User's Request:**\\n    *   **Core Task:** \\\"Say hi in Portuguese.\\\"\\n    *   **Language:** Portuguese.\\n    *   **Action:** Greeting (\\\"hi\\\").\\n    *   **Implicit Need:** The user wants the *correct* and most common way to say hi. They might also appreciate context, as greetings can vary by formality, time of day, and region.\\n\\n2.  **Initial Brainstorming & Keyword Association:**\\n    *   Portuguese -> Brazil, Portugal, Angola, Mozambique, etc.\\n    *   Hi -> Hello, Hey, Oi, Olá.\\n    *   Greetings -> Bom dia, Boa tarde, Boa noite.\\n    *   Informal -> Oi, E aí?, Beleza?\\n    *   Formal -> Olá.\\n    *   Slang/Regional -> Tudo bem?, Tudo bom?\\n\\n3.  **Structure the Answer:** I need to provide a simple, direct answer first, and then add value by giving more context and options. A good structure would be:\\n\\n    *   **Direct, Most Common Answer:** Start with the simplest, most universally understood greeting. This is \\\"Oi.\\\"\\n    *   **Slightly More Formal/Universal:** Introduce \\\"Olá.\\\" Explain the difference in formality and usage.\\n    *   **Time-of-Day Greetings:** This is a crucial part of Portuguese greetings. I must include \\\"Bom dia,\\\" \\\"Boa tarde,\\\" and \\\"Boa noite.\\\" I should also provide translations and explain *when* to use them.\\n    *   **Informal/Slang Greetings (especially Brazilian Portuguese):** This adds a layer of cultural fluency. \\\"E aí?\\\" and \\\"Tudo bem?\\\" are excellent examples. I should explain what they mean (\\\"What's up?\\\" and \\\"How are you?\\\") and that they are often used as greetings themselves.\\n    *   **The \\\"How are you?\\\" Follow-up:** It's natural to ask \\\"How are you?\\\" after a greeting. \\\"Tudo bem?\\\" is the most common. I should include the typical response (\\\"Tudo bem,\\\" \\\"Tudo bom\\\") and maybe a brief explanation of the \\\"bem\\\" vs. \\\"bom\\\" nuance.\\n    *   **Regional Differences (Brazil vs. Portugal):** This is a key point of distinction in Portuguese. I should explicitly mention that \\\"Oi\\\" is very common in Brazil but less so in Portugal, where \\\"Olá\\\" is more standard. This shows a deeper understanding of the language.\\n    *   **Summary Table:** A table is a great way to organize the information visually. It makes it easy for the user to scan and find the right greeting for their situation. Columns should be: Greeting, Translation/Formality, and When to Use.\\n    *   **Putting it all together (Examples):** Show short dialogues to demonstrate how these greetings are used in a real conversation. This makes the information practical. E.g., \\\"Oi, tudo bem?\\\" -> \\\"Tudo bem, e você?\\\"\\n    *   **Closing:** A simple, encouraging closing like \\\"Choose the one that fits your situation!\\\" or something similar.\\n\\n4.  **Fleshing out each section:**\\n\\n    *   **Direct Answer:** \\\"The most common and informal way to say 'hi' in Portuguese (especially in Brazil) is: **Oi!**\\\" - This is clear and direct.\\n\\n    *   **Olá:** \\\"A slightly more formal but still very common way is: **Olá!**\\\" - Add the context: \\\"This is universally understood in both Brazil and Portugal.\\\"\\n\\n    *   **Time of Day:**\\n        *   **Bom dia:** Good morning. (Use until noon/12 PM).\\n        *   **Boa tarde:** Good afternoon. (Use from noon until dark/sunset).\\n        *   **Boa noite:** Good evening/Good night. (Use from sunset on, and also to say goodbye at night). This last point is important and often confuses learners.\\n\\n    *   **Informal/Slang (Brazil):**\\n        *   **E aí?** (Literally \\\"And there?\\\") -> \\\"What's up?\\\" or \\\"Hey.\\\"\\n        *   **Beleza?** (Literally \\\"Beauty?\\\") -> \\\"All good?\\\" or \\\"What's up?\\\"\\n        *   **Tudo bem?** (Literally \\\"Everything well?\\\") -> \\\"How are you?\\\" (Explain it's often used as a greeting itself).\\n\\n    *   **Regional Difference:** Explicitly state: \\\"In Brazil, **Oi** is extremely common. In Portugal, **Olá** is the standard greeting you'll hear most often.\\\"\\n\\n    *   **Table Creation:**\\n        | Greeting | Translation / Formality | When to Use |\\n        |---|---|---|\\n        | Oi! | Hi! / Hey! (Informal) | With friends, family, in casual settings. Very common in Brazil. |\\n        | Olá! | Hello! (Slightly more formal) | Universal, good for any situation. More common in Portugal. |\\n        | Bom dia | Good morning | From sunrise until noon. |\\n        | Boa tarde | Good afternoon | From noon until sunset. |\\n        | Boa noite | Good evening / Good night | From sunset onwards. Also used to say goodbye at night. |\\n        | E aí? | What's up? (Very informal) | With close friends, mostly in Brazil. |\\n        | Tudo bem? | How are you? / All good? | Can be used after \\\"Oi\\\" or as a greeting itself. |\\n\\n    *   **Examples:**\\n        *   *Informal:* \\\"Oi, E aí? Tudo bem?\\\" -> \\\"E aí! Tudo bem, e você?\\\"\\n        *   *Standard:* \\\"Olá, bom dia.\\\" -> \\\"Bom dia! Tudo bem?\\\"\\n        *   *Formal:* \\\"Olá, como vai?\\\" (I could add this one too for extra formality). \\\"Como vai o senhor/a senhora?\\\"\\n\\n5.  **Final Review:** Read through the entire answer. Is it clear? Is it accurate? Is it easy to understand for a beginner? Does it directly answer the user's question while also providing valuable extra information? The structure looks good, the content is accurate and helpful. The examples make it practical. The regional distinction is a key value-add. The table is a great summary. The tone is helpful and encouraging. The answer is ready.\"}}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":16,\"completion_tokens\":1937,\"total_tokens\":1953,\"cost\":0.0040773,\"is_byok\":false,\"prompt_tokens_details\":{\"cached_tokens\":0,\"audio_tokens\":0},\"cost_details\":{\"upstream_inference_cost\":null,\"upstream_inference_prompt_cost\":0.0000096,\"upstream_inference_completions_cost\":0.0040677},\"completion_tokens_details\":{\"reasoning_tokens\":1378,\"image_tokens\":0}}}"
